# Changelog Update

Use this short workflow:

1. Run `bun run changelog:prefill`.
2. Run `bun run changelog:verify` and read missing refs from output.
3. Group related refs into one registry entry where they describe one change.
4. Keep visible entries in German, short and user-facing.
5. Mark technical-only entries with `hide: true` and remove `descriptionMd`.
6. Run `bun run changelog` until verify/build pass.
7. Commit generated changelog files and registry updates with `git commit -m "Update changelog" -m "hide changelog"`

Rules:

- Registry file: `registry.yaml`.
- Visible entry shape: `refs` + `descriptionMd`.
- Hidden entry shape: `refs` + `hide: true` (no description).
